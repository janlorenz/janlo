# Summary

I am a *social data scientist* and *computational social scientist* with a background in complex socio-economic systems and applied mathematics. 

\medskip

I build and use *agent-based models* to study how individual behaviors and interactions lead to emergent social patterns, like polarization, radicalization, filter bubbles, spatial segregation, using behavioral and institutional theories from psychology, sociology, political science and economics. I make formal model from verbal theories looking for systemic mechanisms which go beyond the obvious. My goal is to bring agent-based models closer to data-driven analysis and classical variable-based models in the social sciences. To that end, I also do purely data-driven research with a focus on measuring macroscopic social phenomena. 

\medskip

Further on, I am interested in the voting systems (theory and application), holisitic understanding of the adaptation of democratic systems, collective intelligence, and mathematical concepts underlying machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

# Academic Positions

Besides my first two and a half year postdoc at ETH Zurich, I have been working mostly in the larger Bremen Research Area with a focus on Jacobs/Constructor University. This is the full list.

\medskip

Here I provide a selection of my publications and their contribution by topic:

\cvsubsection{Opinion Dynamics} 

- @LorenzEtAl2021IndividualAttitudeChange
  \textcolor{maincol}{Holostic model of different attitude change mechanisms and their societal implications derived from psychological theory published in a flagship theory journal in psychology.}
- @GeschkeEtAl2019TriplefilterBubbleUsing
  \textcolor{maincol}{Integrates attitude-laden news items of which individuals compose worldviews. Demonstrates a subtle mechansis how the existence of social media resposting creates cognitive filter bubbles in society. Highly recognized.}
- @FlacheEtAl2017ModelsSocialInfluence  
  \textcolor{maincol}{Has become a key introductory paper on opinion dynamics.}
- @GroeberEtAl2014DissonanceMinimizationMicrofoundation
  \textcolor{maincol}{Formal model of opinion dynamics derived from cognitive dissonance theory.}
- @ShinLorenz2010TippingDiffusivityInformation
  \textcolor{maincol}{Shows how just the increasing number of social connections can tip a society from a consensual state into a bipolarized one in a theoretical model. Written before the dominance of social media became real.}

**Empirical Opinion Research**

- @GestefeldEtAl2022DecomposingAttitudeDistributions
  \textcolor{maincol}{Empirical exploration of opinion distributions over different countries, topics, and time using several attitude items from the European Social Survey.}
- @GestefeldLorenz2023CalibratingOpinionDynamics
  \textcolor{maincol}{A first attempt on how to calibrate and validate opinion dynamics models with empirical data, including panel data of individuals.}
- @Lorenz2009UniversalityMovieRating
  \textcolor{maincol}{Analysis of self-scraped movie rating histograms.}

\pagebreak

**Bounded Confidence Model**

\medskip

The beginning of my research was centered around the bounded confidence model. I think it still shows an underappreciated relevant mechanism how a certain form of polarization emerges just through indiviudals assimilating towards others. 

- @Lorenz2007ContinuousOpinionDynamics
  \textcolor{maincol}{Survey showing density-based formalism.}
- @Kurahashi-NakamuraEtAl2016RobustClusteringGeneralized
  \textcolor{maincol}{How only two types of realistic sources of noise together make the model's macroscopic outcome also more realistically looking.}
- @LorenzUrbig2007PowerEnforcePrevent
- @Lorenz2010HeterogeneousBoundsConfidence
  \textcolor{maincol}{How open- and closed-minded agents together in a society create new emergent phenomena like drifting opinion clusters.}
- @Lorenz2008FosteringConsensusMultidimensional
  \textcolor{maincol}{How more unrelated opinion dimensions make consensus harder to achieve, while opinion dimensions connected through budget constraints make it reachable with less open-mindedness.}
- @Lorenz2006ConsensusStrikesBack
  \textcolor{maincol}{Shows a still discussed surprising phenomenon of the basic bounded confidence model.}

\cvsubsection{Segregation}

- @ZuccottiEtAl2023ExploringDynamicsNeighbourhood
  \textcolor{maincol}{Implements Schelling's segregation model in real-world demography and geography and models individuals relocation decisions as classical discrete choice models. Makes the classic agent-based model better relatable to real-world data and variable-based analysis many other segregation research uses.}
- @PaolilloLorenz2018HowDifferentHomophily
  \textcolor{maincol}{Introduces the new type agent to the model: Agents who do not care about the color of their neighbor, but do care about not living with too many other who do prefer to live only among similar colored ones. Interesting new phenomena emerge.}

\cvsubsection{Economic Experiments on Redistribution}

A series of lab experiments on democratic redistribution in groups of five individuals and how the framing of the decision situation and ineffciency of the redistribution mechanism affect the degree of redistribution.

- @TepeEtAl2021EfficiencyLossSupport
- @PaetzelEtAl2017TransparencyDiminishesFramingeffects
- @LorenzEtAl2017JustDontCall

\cvsubsection{Experiments on the Wisdom of Crowds}

The wisdom of crowd effect is the phenomenon that the aggregated judgment of a group of individuals is often more accurate than most individual judgments. I studied how social influence and different decision rules affect the wisdom of crowds in experimental settings using simple factual assessment tasks of numerical nature.

- @LorenzEtAl2015MajoritarianDemocracyUndermines
  \textcolor{maincol}{Shows that communication under a final majority decision illicits less wisdom of crowd than unanimous decision making or pure aggregation instead of collective decision. The reasons for the finding are still not fully understood.}
- @LorenzEtAl2011HowSocialInfluence
  \textcolor{maincol}{Seminal experiment showing that even mild social influence undermines the wisdom of crowds by creating a collective tunnel vision. Highly recognized.}
- @Lorenz2021QuantificationCrowdWisdom
  \textcolor{maincol}{A theoretical exploration of different definitions and quantifications of the wisdom of crowds effect.}

\cvsubsection{Economic Models}

- @KonigEtAl2016InnovationVsImitation
  \textcolor{maincol}{How imitation and innovation interact in an evolutionary model of firms creating a traveling wave of the productivity distribution in line with empirical observation. Published in a flagship theoretical economics journal.}
- @LorenzEtAl2013RedistributionSpursGrowth
  \textcolor{maincol}{Shows that redistribution can increase growth in an agent-based macroeconomic model. All relies on an underappreciated property of muliplicative growth underlying economic and natural growth processes.}

\cvsubsection{Mathematics}

These are my two papers with mathemetical proofs on convergence in opinion dynamics models.

- @LorenzLorenz2010ConditionsConvergenceConsensus
- @Lorenz2005StabilizationTheoremDynamics

\cvsubsection{Miscellaneous}

- @AsgharpourmasoulehEtAl2020FateProtestsDynamics
  \textcolor{maincol}{Agent-based model of protests building on the classical threshold model of Granovetter including multiple topics and different types of protest activation. The model is able to show short-lived but heavy multi topic protests wave like seen in Iran and a long-term protest changing topics like the PEGIDA protests, both seen in the late 2010 years.}
- @LorenzEtAl2017RankOptimalWeightingHow
  \textcolor{maincol}{Most rankings, like university ranking, rely on weighted averages of several indicators. We derive a method to find weights which bring a certain entity as much to the top as possible. We show that it can matter a lot!}
- @Lorenz2018WieKumuliermoglichkeitPanaschieren
  \textcolor{maincol}{Empirical analysis of cumulative voting and panachage behavior, arguing for a change in Bremen's voting system. Based on unique voting data from all ballots in Bremen.}

\cvsubsection{Agent-based Modeling}

Recently, I made some effort to position the use of the method of agent-based modeling and how it can be done data-driven in computational and theoretical social sciences. 

- @Lorenz2025ExploringTheoryAgentbased
- @Lorenz2021DatadrivenAgentbasedModeling


\cvsubsection{Books}

- @KeijzerEtAl2025ComputationalSocialScience
  \textcolor{maincol}{Edited volume as the output of our summer schools and research incubators on social cohesion and the democratic debate. To appear in November 2025}
- @DeutschmannEtAl2020ComputationalConflictResearch
  \textcolor{maincol}{Edited volume as the output of our summer school and research incubator on conflicts.}
- @DragolovEtAl2016SocialCohesionWestern
  \textcolor{maincol}{Established one often used definition and multidimensional measurement concept of social cohesion.}
